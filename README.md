# Clustering
Hierarchical and K-Means Clustering

## A3.ipynb:
	-Open the A3.ipynb file in Jupyterlab.
	-Make sure that dataset1.csv and dataset2.csv are in the same folder as this notebook.
	-Run all the cells in the notebook.
	
## Hierarchical Clustering and Dataset2.ipynb:
	-Open the Hierarchical Clustering and Dataset2.ipynb file in Google Colab.
	-Run each cell by clicking the play button on the left-hand side of the cell.
	-For the second cell, after running it, choose the "dataset2.csv" file from your folder.
	
Following these steps should ensure that both of the notebooks run successfully.

The analysis of the graphs could be found in the report.pdf
